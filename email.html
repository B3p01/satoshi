                I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.

                The main properties:<br>
                  Double-spending is prevented with a peer-to-peer network.
                  No mint or other trusted parties.
                  Participants can be anonymous.
                  New coins are made from Hashcash style proof-of-work. 
                  The proof-of-work for new coin generation also powers the 
                    network to prevent double-spending.

                Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
            </p>
            <p>
                Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
                payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
                financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
                benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
                We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
                The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
                hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
                the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
                events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
                long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
                attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The
                network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort
                basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest
                proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.
